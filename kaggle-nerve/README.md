# kaggle-nerve

This repository contains code I wrote for the Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation Kaggle competition. (NOTE: to be updated with code files after competition end date.)

## Description

"Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management catheter. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images of the neck. Doing so would improve catheter placement and contribute to a more pain free future."

## Files

**GenerateSubmission.py** - code to generate submission (will be uploaded after end date)

**NerveDataExploration.ipynb** - ipython notebook with data exploration (will be uploaded after end date)

**train_masks.csv** - gives the training image masks in run-length encoded format. This is provided as a convenience to demonstrate how to turn image masks into encoded text values for submission. (provided by Kaggle)

**sample_submission.csv** - sample submission format (provided by Kaggle)
